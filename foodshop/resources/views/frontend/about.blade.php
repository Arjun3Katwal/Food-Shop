                <p class="lead">Beginning as early as the 14th century,
                   a grocer (or "purveyor") was a dealer in comestible
                   dry goods such as spices, peppers, sugar, and (later)
                   cocoa, tea, and coffee. Because these items were often
                   bought in bulk, they were named after the French word 
                   for wholesaler, or "grossier". This, in turn, is
                   derived from the Medieval Latin term "grossarius",
                   from which the term "gross" (meaning a quantity of 
                   12 dozen, or 144) is also derived.

                   As increasing numbers of staple food-stuffs became
                   available in cans and other less-perishable packaging,
                   the trade expanded its province. Today, grocers deal
                   in a wide range of staple food-stuffs including such 
                   perishables as dairy products, meats, and produce. 
                   Such goods are, hence, called groceries.</p>
